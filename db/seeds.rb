# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

  places = Place.create([{ name: 'The Arch', address: "50 South Leonor K. Sullivan Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 63102"}, { name: 'The City Museum', address: "750 North 16th Street, St. Louis, MO 63103" }, {name: "St. Louis Zoo", address: "1 Government Dr, St. Louis, MO 63110"}])
